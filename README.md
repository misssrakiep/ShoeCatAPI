# shoeCatalogueAPI

## -Project oveview

This [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) allows a user to enter data through an application called [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/postman). The user of this API can:

* view a list all shoes that are currently in the database
* view all shoes with a given brand
* view all shoes with a given size
* vie all shoes with a given brand and size
* update the stock levels when a shoe is sold
* and add a new shoe to the inventory

This API can be used in conjuction with a front-end application that will rpovide the user with an interface to do all the above mentioned.
